"""Shared secure local-storage helpers for the token + JSON caches.

Every file the MCP writes locally may contain sensitive material (the bearer
token, or personal golf data). These helpers make those writes:

- **user-only readable** (mode 0600), with the restrictive mode applied at
  creation time so there is no world-readable window;
- **atomic** (write to a temp file in the same directory, then `os.replace`),
  so an interrupted or concurrent write can never leave a truncated file; and
- **corruption-safe on read** — an unparseable file is backed up to a
  `.corrupt` sibling and reported to stderr rather than being silently treated
  as empty (which would wipe the user's history without a trace).

Directories are created mode 0700. No secrets are logged.
