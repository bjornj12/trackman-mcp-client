# Publishing

`trackman-mcp` ships through three channels. The PyPI release is automated via
GitHub Actions + PyPI **Trusted Publishing** (OIDC) — no API token is ever
stored. You authorize the workflow once on PyPI, then every `vX.Y.Z` tag
publishes.

## One-time setup: authorize the GitHub workflow on PyPI

Because the project doesn't exist on PyPI yet, use the **pending publisher** flow:

1. Sign in to PyPI → <https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/>.
2. Under **Add a new pending publisher**, fill in exactly:

   | Field | Value |
   |-------|-------|
   | PyPI Project Name | `trackman-mcp` |
   | Owner | `bjornj12` |
   | Repository name | `trackman-mcp-client` |
   | Workflow name | `publish.yml` |
   | Environment name | `pypi` |

3. Save. (Optional but recommended: in GitHub → Settings → Environments, create
   the `pypi` environment and add yourself as a required reviewer — that turns
   each release into a one-click manual approval before upload.)

That's all the PyPI side needs — no token to generate or paste.

## Cut a release — one command

```bash
scripts/release.sh patch          # or: minor | major | an explicit X.Y.Z
scripts/release.sh 0.2.0 --dry-run        # preview everything, change nothing
scripts/release.sh patch --auto-approve   # skip the manual approval pause
```

`release.sh` does the whole thing end to end. Because `main` is **protected**
(no direct pushes), the version bump goes through a PR that you merge:

1. bumps the version in `pyproject.toml`, `server.json`, the plugin + marketplace
   manifests, and the `.mcpb` manifest + launcher (it fails if any file's shape
   drifted). `__version__` is read from the installed metadata, so it's not a
   field you bump.
2. runs the quality gate (`ruff` + `mypy` + `pytest`),
3. pushes a `release-X.Y.Z` branch and opens a PR (you as reviewer),
4. **waits for you to merge the PR** (it opens it in your browser),
5. tags `vX.Y.Z` on `main` and pushes the tag — triggering the publish workflow,
6. waits for the workflow and pauses for your one-click `pypi` approval (or
   approves it for you with `--auto-approve`),
7. waits until PyPI serves the version, then runs `mcp-publisher publish`.

So a release is: run the command → merge the PR it opens → approve the deploy.
The Claude Code plugin needs no publish step (it tracks `main`).

### Manual equivalent

The bump must land on `main` via a PR first (protected branch); the tag must then
match `version` in `pyproject.toml` (the workflow enforces it):

```bash
# on a branch: bump versions, open a PR, merge it, then from main:
git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z   # then approve the `pypi` deployment
```

After the workflow succeeds, anyone can:

```bash
uvx trackman-mcp            # or: uv tool install trackman-mcp / pipx install trackman-mcp
```

## Manual publish (fallback)

```bash
uv build
uv publish                 # prompts for a PyPI API token
```

## List on the MCP Registry (after the PyPI release)

`server.json` is already validated against the registry schema. Once the PyPI
package exists:

```bash
# install the publisher CLI (see github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry)
mcp-publisher login github      # authorizes the io.github.bjornj12/* namespace
mcp-publisher publish           # reads ./server.json
```

Bump the `version` in **both** `pyproject.toml` and `server.json` for each
release so the registry entry tracks the PyPI package.

## Claude Code plugin

No release step — the plugin builds from the repo via `uvx --from`, so it tracks
`main`. Bump `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (and `marketplace.json`)
when you want to signal a new plugin version to users.
